## Session Log

### Session 14 — Vision Gaps (Remaining)

**Goal:** Close the remaining gaps identified in `ledger/vision.md §4 — What's Missing`.

#### P0 — Critical

- [ ] **Add namespace validation webhook** — Scaffold via `kubebuilder create webhook --group runners --version v1alpha1 --kind EventTrigger --programmatic-validation`. Validate: `Webhook.Path` uniqueness, `WorkflowTemplate.Name` non-empty, `AllowedNamespaces` entries valid DNS labels. **Blocked on cert-manager install** — cert-manager must be running in the cluster before scaffolding. Setup docs added to `arch/blueprint.md` §Cert-Manager Setup. Scaffold command: `kubebuilder create webhook --group runners --version v1alpha1 --kind EventTrigger --programmatic-validation`.

- [x] **GitRepo secret pre-flight validation** — ✅ Implemented: `validateGitRepoSecret(ctx, runner)` checks that the Git auth Secret exists and contains all required keys (ssh-privatekey, username+password, or token) before the Job is created. Key-checking logic extracted to pure function `checkSecretHasKeys` with 5 unit tests. Condition `ReasonRunnerValidationFailed` + K8s Event on failure.
- [x] **CSI/external-secrets compatibility** — ✅ `validateGitRepoSecret` no longer hard-errors when the Secret is not found. Instead logs a warning and proceeds, allowing secrets provided by `SecretProviderClass` (CSI), External Secrets Operator, or similar mechanisms to work without a real K8s Secret resource.

#### P1 — Important

- [x] **Capture Pod logs in Workflow step status** — ✅ Implemented: `fetchPodLogs` helper fetches last 50 lines of "runner" container logs (capped at 4 KiB) when a step transitions to Failed. Stored in `StepStatus.Message`. Uses `kubernetes.Clientset` from reconciler, initialized in `SetupWithManager`. RBAC for pods + pods/log added.
- [x] **EventTrigger workflow ownership** — ✅ Already implemented (commit `a4c1440`). `server.go:340` calls `controllerutil.SetControllerReference` before creating the workflow.
- [x] **Implement `gitRepo.Path`** — ✅ Already handled by Session 13 refactoring: `script.go:36-42` validates path existence in init container; `runner_controller.go:153-157` sets `WorkingDir` with path. Original task was stale — written before the gitops factory replaced `buildGitInitContainer`.

#### P2 — Nice to Have

- [x] **Workflow step DAG topological sort** — ✅ Implemented: `topologicalSortSteps` (Kahn's algorithm) sorts steps by dependency order. Wired into `reconcileFlatWorkflow` and `reconcileJobSteps` before the reconcile loop. 3 unit tests (no-deps, linear chain, count preservation).
- [x] **Prometheus metrics** — ✅ Implemented: `internal/controller/metrics.go` with `RunnerJobCompletedTotal`, `WorkflowPhaseTransitions`, `WorkflowDurationSeconds`, `StepRetriesTotal`. Registered via controller-runtime `metrics.Registry`. Incremented at each phase transition in both Runner and Workflow controllers.
- [x] **Namespace quotas** — ✅ Implemented: annotation `runner-operator.io/max-concurrent-workflows` on Namespace resource. Checked in both flat and job workflow paths before first reconcile. Requeues with condition when quota exceeded. RBAC for namespace read added.
- [x] **Cross-namespace template workflow decision** — ✅ Decision documented in `arch/blueprint.md`: template lives in any namespace; created Workflow lives in trigger namespace (tenant isolation). Already implemented in `server.go:299`.
- [x] **SharedVolume PVC cross-namespace docs** — ✅ Documented in `arch/blueprint.md`: PVC refs are namespace-scoped per K8s design; use EmptyDir or CSI for cross-namespace.
- [x] **Expose `--webhook-event-port` flag docs** — ✅ Added `--webhook-event-addr=:8080` to `config/manager/manager.yaml` args. Documented in `arch/blueprint.md` design decisions.
- [x] **Improve Conditions** — ✅ Implemented: `internal/controller/conditions.go` with `ConditionBuilder` factory (builder pattern), `ConditionTypeReady` constant, and predefined reason codes for all state transitions. All three controllers (Runner, Workflow, EventTrigger) now set proper `metav1.Condition` with `Reason`/`Message`/`ObservedGeneration` at every phase transition. 7 unit tests covering defaults, chaining, upsert, and per-controller helpers.

#### Chores

- [x] **Add CI check for README examples** — 🔲 Needs implementation. Use `kubeconform` or `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` to catch drift.
- [x] **Add markdownlint CI check** — ✅ Added `.markdownlint.yaml` config + `DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v19` step in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`.
- [x] **Dependabot config** — ✅ Added `.github/dependabot.yml` with gomod (weekly, grouped by ecosystem) + GitHub Actions (weekly) schedules.
- [x] **Network isolation docs** — ✅ Added `config/network-policy/isolate-tenants.yaml` with tenant isolation NetworkPolicy (blocks cross-tenant traffic, allows operator + DNS). Registered in `kustomization.yaml`.
- [x] **Audit logging for cross-namespace ops** — ✅ Added structured log + K8s Event in `buildStepRunner` when RunnerRef is resolved from a different namespace than the workflow.
- [x] **Step timeout enforcement** — ✅ Already implemented via `Runner.TimeoutAfter` → `Job.ActiveDeadlineSeconds`. The K8s Job controller enforces pod deadline; Runner controller detects and surfaces failure. Adding operator-side polling would be redundant.
- [x] **Validation webhook cert-manager docs** — ✅ Added "Cert-Manager Setup" section to `arch/blueprint.md` with prerequisites, Helm config, and kubebuilder scaffold command.
- [x] **Metrics default HTTP** — ✅ Default changed to 8080/HTTP in `--metrics-secure=false`, `dist/chart/values.yaml`, Kustomize patches. TLS via cert-manager optional.

### Session 13 — GitOps Factory & Workflow Deduplication

**Work Done:**
- **`internal/gitops/` factory package** — `NewAuthStrategy(gitRepo)` returns `AuthStrategy` interface with `BuildInitContainer`, `BuildVolumes`, `BuildCloneScript`. Three strategies: `noAuthStrategy` (public), `sshAuthStrategy` (SSH keys), `httpAuthStrategy` (token/basic auth). Replaces inline git init logic duplicated in `runner_controller.go` and `workflow_controller.go`. **98.8% test coverage** via 25 unit tests.
- **`reconcileStepLoop` extraction** — Unified `reconcileSteps` + `reconcileJobSteps` (~85% overlap) into single function driven by `buildRunner func(step) *Runner` closure.
- **`cycleDetector[T any]`** — Generic 3-color DFS replaces `detectCycle` + `detectJobCycle` (~95% overlap). Type-safe via generics.
- **`computeWorkflowPhase[T any]`** — Generic phase aggregation replaces `computeFlatWorkflowPhase` + `computeJobWorkflowPhase` (~90% overlap).
- **API type changes:** Added `GitAuthType` enum, `GitRepo.Image` field, changed `SecretRef` to value type. Ran `make generate` for deepcopy regeneration.
- **Inline WHAT/WHY docs** — Added engineer-facing documentation to all refactored code blocks.
- **`make test`** — all passing. **`make test-e2e`** — 11/11 specs passing (173s on isolated Kind cluster `runner-operator-test-e2e`).

**Files modified:**
- `internal/gitops/` (new) — 7 files: `git.go`, `git_test.go`, `auth.go`, `auth_test.go`, `clone.go`, `clone_test.go`, `initcontainer.go`
- `internal/controller/runner_controller.go` — git init replaced with gitops factory calls
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go` — `reconcileStepLoop`, `cycleDetector[T]`, `computeWorkflowPhase[T]`, git init replaced with factory calls
- `api/v1alpha1/runner_types.go` — `GitAuthType`, `GitRepo.Image`, `SecretRef` value type
- `api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` — regenerated

**Verification:**
- `make test` — 25 new unit tests, all passing
- `make lint-fix` — 0 issues
- `go build ./...` — OK
- `make test-e2e` — 11/11 specs passing

**Key Decisions:**
- `AuthStrategy` as interface (not func pointer) — allows multiple builders per strategy, extensible for future auth methods
- Generics for `cycleDetector[T]` and `computeWorkflowPhase[T]` — type safety without interface{} cast, zero runtime overhead
- Timeout handlers NOT extracted — genuinely different logic (nested vs flat loops); extraction would add indirection without real savings
- `SecretRef` value type — needed for GitAuth factory; `make generate` regenerated deepcopy

---

### Session 12 — Cross-Namespace Fixes & Release Workflow Hardening

**Work Done:**
- **Session 10 P1 items (all 4):**
  - fetch-depth: changed 0 → 1 + explicit `git fetch --tags`
  - Release notes: added `--no-merges` to `git log`
  - gh-pages: added branch existence check before worktree; removed `|| true` masking
  - URLs: parameterized all hardcoded GitHub URLs via `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY` in release workflow
- **Session 10 P2 (5 of 8):**
  - Verified ingress file exists
  - Fixed NetworkPolicy CIDR docs with pod CIDR note + broader RFC 1918 ranges
  - Corrected CRD preserveUnknownFields doc (default prunes, not preserves)
  - Added `kubectl logs` alternative to stern
  - Updated runnerRef CRD table to new RunnerRef type
- **Session 11 P0 (2 of 3):**
  - RunnerRef: new custom type with Name+Namespace, cross-namespace resolution in controller
  - AllowedNamespaces: enforced in webhook server + controller with status/events
  - Validation webhook: deferred (requires cert-manager scaffold)
- **Session 11 P1 (1 of 4):**
  - Webhook server RBAC: added namespace read permission

**Files modified:**
- `.github/workflows/release-chart.yaml` — 4 improvements
- `api/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go` — new RunnerRef type, updated WorkflowStep field
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go` — cross-namespace resolution in buildStepRunner
- `internal/webhook/events/server.go` — AllowedNamespaces enforcement in createWorkflow
- `internal/controller/eventtrigger_controller.go` — AllowedNamespaces enforcement + RBAC marker
- `README.md` — CRD table update, NetworkPolicy docs, preserveUnknownFields fix, stern alternative
- `config/crd/bases/` — regenerated (RunnerRef schema change)
- `config/rbac/role.yaml` — regenerated (namespace RBAC marker)
- `api/v1alpha1/eventtrigger_types.go` — removed `omitempty` from `Registered bool` (was swallowing `false` in JSON patches)
- `api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` — regenerated (RunnerRef DeepCopy)
- `test/e2e/e2e_test.go` — RunnerRefCrossNamespace + AllowedNamespaces test contexts

**Verification:**
- `make test` — passing
- `make lint-fix` — 0 issues
- `go build ./...` — OK
- **`make test-e2e` — 11/11 specs passing** (RunnerRefCrossNamespace + AllowedNamespaces now green after `omitempty` fix)

---

### Session 1 — Project Scaffolding & CRDs

**Work Done:**
- Initialized Kubebuilder v4.14.0 project (`go.kubebuilder.io/v4`, domain `runner-operator.io`)
- Defined **Runner** CRD (`runners.runner-operator.io/v1alpha1`):
  - Spec: Image, Env, EnvFrom, Volumes, Mounts, Args, Command, TimeoutAfter
  - Status: Phase, Conditions, ResourceHash (drift tracking), StartTime, CompletionTime
- Defined **Workflow** CRD (same group/version):
  - Spec: Steps with Name, Image/RunnerRef, Command, Args, Env, DependsOn, When (`on_success`/`on_failure`/`always`), Retry (MaxRetries + BackoffConfig), Timeout
  - Status: Phase, StepStatuses, Conditions
- Implemented `kustomize` with `vars` for namespace injection
- Created `requirements.md` at `arch/requirments.md`

### Session 2 — Controllers & Tests

**Work Done:**
- Implemented **Runner controller** (`internal/controller/runner_controller.go`):
  - Creates `batch/v1.Job` from Runner spec
  - SHA-256 spec hash drift detection (recreates Job on change)
  - Finalizer for Job cleanup
  - Status reconciliation (Job phase → Runner phase)
- Implemented **Workflow controller** (`internal/controller/workflow_controller.go`):
  - DAG evaluation via `dependsOn` / `when` conditions
  - Creates Runner resources per step (with owner references)
  - Step status tracking (Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed)
  - Finalizer for owned Runner cleanup
- Wrote unit tests (`internal/controller/*_test.go`) — passing via `make test`
- Wrote **E2E tests** (`test/e2e/e2e_test.go`) — 4/4 specs passing on Kind:
  1. Manager pod is running
  2. Metrics endpoint is available
  3. Runner → Job → Succeeded lifecycle
  4. Workflow chained steps → Succeeded
- Set up CI workflows (`.github/workflows/`):
  - `test.yml` — unit tests
  - `test-e2e.yml` — E2E on Kind
  - `lint.yml` — golangci-lint
- Added `bin/` to `.gitignore`
- Committed and pushed to `main`

**Key Decisions:**
- Runner maps to `batch/v1.Job` (not bare Pods) for built-in retry/backoff/completion
- Controller uses OwnerReferences + K8s GC for cleanup (no finalizers)
- Workflow `when` uses string keywords (no complex expression evaluation)
- Removed `Multiplier` from BackoffConfig to avoid CRD float serialization issues; backoff uses fixed doubling
- E2E tests use separate `runner-operator-test` namespace (no restricted security policy)

### Session 3 — Code Review (Gemini)

**Work Done:**
- Invoked Gemini CLI to scan full project source
- Received 9-item prioritized improvement plan
- Created this ledger (`ledger/tasks.md`)

### Session 4 — Fix Gemini Review Findings

**Work Done:**
- **P0: Fixed retry logic** — `runnerPhaseToStepPhase` now does honest phase mapping. Retry handling moved to `reconcileSteps`: deletes failed Runner, increments `RetryCount`, sets phase to `StepPhaseRunning`
- **P0: Switched to Status().Patch** — Both controllers now use `client.MergeFrom` + `Status().Patch` instead of `Status().Update`, eliminating 409 conflict errors
- **P0: Added SecurityContext to Jobs** — Pod `SecurityContext` (RunAsNonRoot, Seccomp) and container `SecurityContext` (no privilege escalation, read-only rootfs, drop all caps) on all created Jobs
- **P1: Fixed destructive drift** — Runner controller now skips Job deletion when Job is running (has `StartTime` but no `CompletionTime`)
- **P1: Removed redundant finalizers** — Both controllers rely on OwnerReferences + K8s GC for cleanup. Removed `RunnerFinalizer`, `WorkflowFinalizer`, `reconcileDelete` functions, and finalizer RBAC markers
- **P2: Removed polling requeue** — Workflow controller no longer returns `RequeueAfter: 10s`; relies on `Owns(Runner)` for event-driven reconciliation
- **P2: Added resource limits** — Added `Resources corev1.ResourceRequirements` to `RunnerSpec`, wired into Job container spec

**Changes to notes:**
- Key decision updated: "Controller uses OwnerReferences + K8s GC for cleanup (no finalizers)"

---

## Completed Tasks

### P0 — Critical ✓

- [x] **Fix retry logic** — Increment `RetryCount` on failure; delete failed Runner to allow recreation
- [x] **Switch to Status().Patch** — Replace `Status().Update` with `Status().Patch` to avoid 409 conflicts
- [x] **Add SecurityContext to Jobs** — `runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation=false`, drop caps, seccomp

### P1 — Important ✓

- [x] **Fix destructive drift** — Don't kill running Jobs on non-critical spec changes
- [x] **Remove redundant finalizers** — Rely on OwnerReferences + GC instead

### P2 — Nice to Have ✓

- [x] **Remove polling requeue** — Workflow controller: stop 10s requeue, use event-driven only
- [x] **Add resource limits** — Expose CPU/Memory `ResourceRequirements` in RunnerSpec

### Session 5 — Gemini Re-review + Follow-up Fixes

**Work Done:**
- Re-invoked Gemini for a follow-up review of the fixed code
- Fixed **Workflow status persistence** — StartTime/Phase/CompletionTime changes now correctly set `updated = true` to trigger a patch
- Fixed **redundant pointer comparison** — Added `metav1TimePtrEqual` helper to compare `*metav1.Time` by value instead of pointer, eliminating redundant patches
- Fixed **CompletedAt on retry** — `upsertStepStatus` now clears `CompletedAt` when a step transitions back to Running (retry)
- Fixed **RunnerRef logic** — `buildStepRunner` now fetches the referenced Runner template and uses its `Spec` as a base, with step-level fields overriding (instead of using the Runner name as image)

**Gemini second review verdict:** "The operator is much more robust" — all previous critical issues resolved.

### Session 5 — Code Review & Improvement Plan

**Work Done:**
- Performed comprehensive codebase scan via `opencode`
- Identified 20 improvement areas across API design, controller logic, observability, testing, and code quality
- Prioritized top 5 most impactful: Conditions population, validating webhooks, timeout enforcement, retry backoff, events + ObservedGeneration

### Session 6 & 7 — Implement Improvements & E2E Tests (opencode)

**Work Done:**
- **Populated `ObservedGeneration`** in both `RunnerStatus` and `WorkflowStatus`, set on every successful reconciliation
- **Added Event recording** to both controllers:
  - Runner: JobCreated, SpecDrift, PhaseChanged
  - Workflow: NoSteps, CycleDetected, TimedOut, PhaseChanged, StepRunnerCreated, StepRetrying
- **Enforced Workflow timeout** — `handleTimeout()` marks all incomplete steps as Failed, sets workflow phase to Failed, and patches CompletionTime
- **Implemented retry backoff** — `retryBackoffElapsed()` computes exponential backoff (`InitialDelay * 2^retryCount`, capped at `MaxDelay`) and waits before retrying
- **Fixed `When` docs** — Changed from incorrect `"success()"`/`"always()"` examples to actual accepted values `"on_success"`, `"on_failure"`, `"always"`
- **Added step name sanitization** — `sanitizeStepName()` lowercases, replaces invalid chars, truncates to 50 chars for safe K8s resource names
- **Fixed retry phase** — Changed from `StepPhaseRunning` to `StepPhasePending` when retrying (Runner hasn't started yet)
- **Added DAG cycle detection** — `detectCycle()` uses DFS to find dependency cycles and surfaces via events
- **Made dev logging configurable** — Changed `--zap-devel` flag (defaults to `false`), controlled via `Development` option
- **Added RBAC markers** for `events.k8s.io` on both controllers

**Test Results:** `make test` — 2/2 passing, coverage 41.2% (up from 32.4%)
**Lint:** `make lint-fix` — 0 issues

### Session 7 — Improve E2E Tests

**Work Done:**
- **Fixed cleanup** — Added ClusterRoleBinding deletion in `AfterAll` to prevent resource leaks
- **Added Runner failure test** (`RunnerFailure` context) — Creates a Runner that exits non-zero (`exit 1`), verifies it reaches `Failed` phase and the underlying Job reports failure
- **Added spec drift test** (`SpecDrift` context) — Creates a Runner, waits for completion, updates the command, verifies the Job is recreated with a new UID, then verifies the Runner completes successfully with the new spec
- **Added Workflow timeout test** (`WorkflowTimeout` context) — Creates a Workflow with a 10s timeout and a step that runs for 120s, verifies the workflow reaches `Failed` and sets `completionTime`
- **Added Workflow on_failure test** (`WorkflowOnFailure` context) — Creates a Workflow where step-one fails (`exit 1`) and step-two runs with `when: "on_failure"`, verifies step-one fails, step-two succeeds, and the workflow overall is `Failed`
- **Fixed syntax bug** — Added missing closing `)` at end of `Describe(...)` call, which caused a compile error

**E2E compilation:** `go vet -tags=e2e ./test/e2e/` — OK
**Lint:** `make lint-fix` — 0 issues

---

### Session 16 — External Code Review (ReviewScorer)

**Review score: 7/10.** 15 findings spanning validation, HA operability, test depth, CRD schemas, and resource efficiency.

**Source:** `REVIEW_SCORING.md` — fanned out to `ledger/review.md` as actionable task items.

**Key findings by severity:**

| Sev | Finding | Effort | Leads to |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|
| 🔴 Critical | No admission/validation webhooks (F1) | 4h | ST-1 |
| 🟠 High | Integration tests are smoke-only (F2) | 5h | ST-3 |
| 🟠 High | Rate limiting per-replica, HA bypass (F3) | 5h | MT-2 |
| 🟠 High | Namespace quota is O(N) list (F4) | 3h | MT-1 |

## Next Major Features — Event Triggers, Job Grouping, Webhooks

### Session 8 — Architecture Design (opencode)

**Context:** Three major features requested: event-driven triggers (GitHub webhooks → workflow creation), job grouping (parallel job sets with `needs`), and an HTTP webhook endpoint exposed via Ingress.

**Work Done:**
- Comprehensive gap analysis: 30 GitHub Actions features audited — 5 fully implemented, 7 partially, 18+ missing
- Explored existing infrastructure: no webhook server, no ingress, no HTTP framework, controller-runtime manager on 9443/8081
- Made 4 architectural decisions via engineering judgment (see `arch/blueprint.md` — ADR section updated)

**Engineering Decisions (ADRs):**

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| ADR-5 | Webhook server location | **Integrated** into manager binary on port 8080 | Single deployment, lightweight processing, can extract later if needed |
| ADR-6 | Job grouping model | **Logical groups with shared PVC** — steps within a job share a volume; each step still creates a Runner CR | Minimal change to existing architecture; parallel jobs via controller coordination; shared volume for artifacts |
| ADR-7 | EventTrigger CRD | **New CRD** with webhook path, HMAC secret, workflow template ref, parameter mapping | Declarative, Kubernetes-native, controller can reconcile |
| ADR-8 | Parameter extraction | **Dot-path JSON field selectors** (e.g., `$.ref`, `$.repository.full_name`) | Zero new dependencies, sufficient for common webhook fields, can upgrade to CEL later |

**Key Changes to Notes:**
- Blueprint updated at `arch/blueprint.md` with ADR section, webhook server diagram, EventTrigger CRD spec, and extended Workflow with Jobs
- Requirements updated at `arch/requirements.md` with new must/should items for event triggers, webhooks, and job grouping

### Session 9 — Implementation (opencode)

**Work Done (all phases complete):**

| Phase | Status | What |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1a | ✅ | Extended `WorkflowSpec` with `Jobs []JobSpec` (backward-compatible; `Steps` fallback when `Jobs` empty) |
| 1b | ✅ | Added `JobStatus` tracking to `WorkflowStatus`, `SharedVolume` type for artifact passing between steps in a job |
| 1c | ✅ | Rewrote `Reconcile` to dispatch to job-based (`reconcileJobWorkflow`) or flat-step path; added `detectJobCycle`, `evaluateJobWhen`, `reconcileJobSteps`, `buildJobStepRunner` with shared volume injection, `computeJobWorkflowPhase` |
| 2 | ✅ | Created `EventTrigger` CRD via kubebuilder scaffold; added safety fields: `WebhookConfig.Path`, `WebhookConfig.SecretRef` (HMAC), `WebhookConfig.AllowedIPs`, `ParameterMapping.Sanitize`, `RateLimitConfig.MaxPerMinute`, `RateLimitConfig.MaxConcurrent`, `AllowedNamespaces` |
| 3 | ✅ | Built `internal/webhook/events/server.go` — HTTP server on port 8080 (manager Runnable), GitHub HMAC-SHA256 validation, payload size limit (1MB), dot-path parameter extraction, rate limiter, IP whitelist, request logging middleware |
| 4 | ✅ | Updated `EventTriggerReconciler` — registers routes on webhook server on create/update, deregisters on delete, fires K8s Events for registration success/failure |
| 5 | ✅ | Created `config/webhook/webhook_event_service.yaml` (Service port 80→8080), `config/webhook/kustomization.yaml`; added port 8080 to manager Deployment |
| 6 | 🔲 | Tests — unit tests exist but no dedicated tests yet for new paths |

**Safety features built into EventTrigger:**
- HMAC-SHA256 payload validation (GitHub X-Hub-Signature-256)
- Payload size capped at 1MB
- Rate limiting (configurable max per minute)
- IP CIDR whitelist
- Parameter sanitization (strips shell metacharacters)
- Secret handling via K8s Secrets (never logged or exposed in error messages)
- Webhook route deregistration on trigger deletion

**Key implementation details:**
- `buildJobStepRunner` injects shared volume (emptyDir/PVC), job-level env vars, and job-level gitRepo into each step's Runner spec
- Steps in a job get label `runner-operator.io/job: <name>` for filtering
- `evaluateJobWhen` supports `on_success`, `on_failure`, `always` at the job level (same semantics as step-level `when`)
- Jobs without `needs` run in parallel; jobs with `needs` wait for dependencies
- Existing flat-step Workflows continue to work unchanged (backward compatible)
- Parameter extraction uses safe dot-path JSON selectors (`$.ref`, `$.repository.full_name`)
- Workflow template lookup uses the referenced Workflow CR as a blueprint; parameters injected as env vars on the first step

**Test Results:** `make test` — passing (23.4% coverage), `make lint` — 0 issues
**Build:** `go build ./...` — OK

---

## Session 10 — Code Review Follow-up (Latest 3 Commits)

**Work Done:**
- Reviewed commits 7de5dec (release workflow), 91602e1 (kustomization), 2484058 (README)

### P1 — Important ✓

- [x] **Release workflow: fetch-depth optimization** — Changed `fetch-depth: 0` to `fetch-depth: 1` + `git fetch --tags` in `.github/workflows/release-chart.yaml:15-20`
- [x] **Release workflow: clean release notes** — Added `--no-merges` to `git log` in release notes generation (lines 61, 63)
- [x] **Release workflow: gh-pages error handling** — Added explicit `git ls-remote --exit-code` check for gh-pages branch before worktree; replaced `|| true` with proper `git diff --cached --quiet` guard
- [x] **Release workflow + README: parameterize GitHub URLs** — Replaced hardcoded `mohamedhabas11/runner_operator` with `$OWNER/$REPO` from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env var

### P2 — Nice to Have

- [x] **README: verify ingress example file** — `config/webhook/ingress.yaml` exists ✅
- [x] **README: fix NetworkPolicy CIDR** — Added pod CIDR note and broadened `except` list to include all RFC 1918 ranges
- [x] **README: fix CRD preserveUnknownFields doc** — Corrected statement: structural schemas prune unknown fields by default; added workaround note
- [x] **README: note stern as optional** — Added `kubectl logs` alternative for controller logs
- [x] **README: update runnerRef CRD docs** — Changed from `LocalObjectReference` to new `RunnerRef` type (name + namespace)
- [x] **Add CI check for README examples** — Migrated to Session 14 chores (pending implementation)
- [x] **Add markdownlint/vale check** — ✅ Added markdownlint CI in Session 15; vale deferred

---

## Session 11 — Cross-Namespace & Multi-Tenancy Deep Dive

**Work Done:**
- Analyzed RBAC, manager deployment, controller watching, webhook server, CRD types
- Identified 10 gaps preventing reliable cross-namespace operation

### P0 — Critical (Incorrectness)

- [x] **RunnerRef: add Namespace field** — Changed `RunnerRef *corev1.LocalObjectReference` to custom `RunnerRef` type with `Name`+`Namespace` in `api/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go:62`. Updated `buildStepRunner` at `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go:359` to resolve cross-namespace. CRD regenerated with `make manifests generate`.
- [x] **Enforce AllowedNamespaces** — Added check in `internal/webhook/events/server.go:createWorkflow` (rejects if trigger namespace not in allowed list). Added enforcement in `EventTriggerReconciler.Reconcile` with status patch and event. Added RBAC marker for namespace read.
- [ ] **Add namespace validation webhook** — Deferred. Requires cert-manager + admission webhook TLS + kubebuilder scaffold. Needs separate session. See Deferred section.

### P1 — Important (Robustness)

- [ ] **EventTrigger workflow ownership** — In `server.go:createWorkflow`, set `controllerutil.SetControllerReference(trigger, workflow, scheme)` so deleting an EventTrigger cleans up created workflows. Requires trigger and workflow in same namespace.
- [ ] **Cross-namespace template workflow** — Decide: create workflow in template namespace (for reuse) or trigger namespace (for isolation). Document decision. If template namespace, update `server.go:299`.
- [ ] **SharedVolume PVC cross-namespace** — Document that PVC references are namespace-scoped. For cross-namespace job grouping, use EmptyDir or CSI-driven cross-namespace volumes.
- [x] **Webhook server RBAC** — Added `// +kubebuilder:rbac:groups=core,resources=namespaces,verbs=get;list;watch` to EventTrigger controller. Generated ClusterRole updated.

## Session 17 — Close Remaining Review Findings

**Goal:** Complete I-3 (Helm README), ST-3 (path collision test), ST-4 (secret watch test), ST-5 (parameter injection test), regenerate dist.

**Work Done:**
- **I-3:** README updated to reflect `--leader-elect` binary default changed to `true` (line 214). Helm chart already had `args: ["--leader-elect"]`.
- **ST-3:** Added path collision integration test for EventTrigger — verifies `PathCollision` condition set on duplicate path, first trigger unaffected. 2 new specs (17→18 total). Coverage 49.4% → 50.4%.
- **ST-4:** Added 6 unit tests for `mapSecretToTriggers` — matching secret, unrelated secret, non-Secret object, namespace mismatch, trigger without webhook, empty namespace in SecretRef. Coverage 50.4% → 52.3%.
- **ST-5:** Added `TestExtractParamsRequired` (3 subtests: non-required → ok, required existing → ok, required missing → error). Added `TestCreateWorkflowInjectsParamsIntoAllSteps` (multi-step + multi-job: verifies all steps get injected params). Webhook coverage 31.7% → 33.7%.
- Regenerated `dist/install.yaml` via `make build-installer`.
- Updated `ledger/review.md` marking 3 more items as [x].

### P2 — Nice to Have (Operational)

- [ ] **Namespace quotas** — Add `NamespaceQuota` field to WorkflowSpec or integrate with Kubernetes ResourceQuota to limit concurrent workflows per namespace.
- [ ] **Tenant-aware metrics** — Add `namespace` label to all Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes Events for cost attribution.
- [ ] **Network isolation** — Add namespace isolation network policies between tenant namespaces.
- [ ] **Audit logging** — Log all cross-namespace operations with tenant identity for compliance.

### Session 18 — Volumes & Mounts for Workflow Steps and Jobs

**Problem:** Workflow steps and jobs had no way to declare volumes or volume mounts, making the operator unsuitable for ephemeral CI runners that need access to docker sockets, PVCs, configmaps, secrets, etc.

**Changes:**

1. **`api/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go`** — Added fields:
   - `WorkflowStep.Volumes []corev1.Volume` — step-level volumes
   - `WorkflowStep.Mounts []corev1.VolumeMount` — step-level volume mounts
   - `JobSpec.Volumes []corev1.Volume` — job-level volumes (applied to all steps in the job)
   - `JobSpec.Mounts []corev1.VolumeMount` — job-level volume mounts

2. **`internal/controller/workflow_controller.go`** — Propagation logic:
   - `buildStepRunner`: Sets Volumes/Mounts from the step onto the Runner spec. When using `RunnerRef`, step-level Volumes/Mounts **override** the template (matching existing pattern for `Env`, `Command`, etc.)
   - `buildJobStepRunner`: Merges job-level Volumes/Mounts into each step's Runner spec, **prepended** before step-level values (same merge direction as `Env`)

**Volume resolution order (last wins on name conflict):**

| Layer | Source | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | RunnerRef template volumes | `buildStepRunner` with `RunnerRef` |
| 2 | Job-level volumes | `buildJobStepRunner` (prepended) |
| 3 | Step-level volumes | `buildStepRunner` (set directly) |
| 4 | SharedVolume volumes | `buildJobStepRunner` (appended) |
| 5 | GitRepo volumes | `runner_controller.go` `buildJob` (appended) |

**Session 18 addendum — ServiceAccountName field:**

Added `ServiceAccountName` to all three levels (Runner, WorkflowStep, JobSpec) following Kubernetes best practice that workloads specify their service account.

- `RunnerSpec.ServiceAccountName` → set as `PodSpec.ServiceAccountName` in `buildJob`
- `WorkflowStep.ServiceAccountName` → set on Runner spec in `buildStepRunner`; overrides template when using `RunnerRef`
- `JobSpec.ServiceAccountName` → used as default for steps when step-level is empty (same pattern as `GitRepo`)
- Updated `dist/chart/templates/samples/workflow-volumes.yaml` to demonstrate job-level + step-level service accounts

**Files modified:**
- `api/v1alpha1/runner_types.go` — 1 new field
- `api/v1alpha1/workflow_types.go` — 2 new fields (step + job)
- `internal/controller/runner_controller.go` — wired to PodSpec
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go` — wired in `buildStepRunner` and `buildJobStepRunner`
- `dist/chart/templates/samples/workflow-volumes.yaml` — added SA examples
- `config/crd/bases/` — regenerated
- `api/v1alpha1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` — regenerated
- `dist/chart/templates/crd/` — 3 CRDs synced
- `dist/install.yaml` — regenerated
- `internal/controller/runner_controller_unit_test.go` — 3 new unit tests for SA default/custom/empty
- `internal/controller/runner_controller_test.go` — 2 new integration tests for SA propagation to Job
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller_test.go` — 5 new integration tests: step SA, job SA default, step-override-job, empty SA, job empty SA

**Tests added — ServiceAccountName behavior:**

| Level | Test | What it verifies |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Runner unit | `TestBuildJob_SA_default` | Empty SA → PodSpec SA empty (uses namespace default) |
| Runner unit | `TestBuildJob_SA_custom` | Set SA → PodSpec SA matches |
| Runner unit | `TestBuildJob_SA_emptyString` | Explicit "" → PodSpec SA empty |
| Runner int | `default` | Reconcile without SA → Job PodSpec SA empty |
| Runner int | `custom` | Reconcile with SA → Job PodSpec SA matches |
| Workflow int | `step SA` | Step-level SA → Runner spec SA matches |
| Workflow int | `empty step SA` | No step SA → Runner spec SA empty |
| Workflow int | `job SA default` | Job-level SA, no step SA → Runner inherits job SA |
| Workflow int | `step overrides job` | Job-level + step-level SA → Runner uses step SA |
| Workflow int | `neither set` | No SA at any level → Runner spec SA empty |

**Verification:**
- `make manifests generate build-installer` — OK
- `helm lint dist/chart` — 0 failures
- `make test` — all passing (15.7s controller, coverage 51.7% → 59.4%)
- `go vet ./...` — OK

**Future considerations:**
- No validation webhook exists yet — invalid volume specs will fail at Job creation time (K8s admission)
- Chart CRDs must be manually synced when CRDs change (helm plugin is one-time scaffold; `make manifests` only updates `config/crd/bases/`)

### Session 19 — RBAC gaps & ReadOnlyRootFilesystem fix

**Source:** Integration tester `findings.log` (v0.3.3 chart)

| # | Finding | Fix |
|---|---------|-----|
| 1 | `namespaces` only `get` verb in workflow controller | Changed to `get;list;watch` (`workflow_controller.go:49`) |
| 2 | `pods` missing `delete` verb in runner controller | Added `delete` to existing `get;list;watch` (`runner_controller.go:48`) |
| 3 | `*/finalizers` missing | **Skipped** — operator relies on OwnerReferences + GC, not finalizers (Session 4 decision) |
| 4 | Workflow `steps` → `jobs[].steps[]` restructure | Backward compatible; no action needed |
| 5 | `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem: true` breaks many images | Added `RunnerSpec.SecurityContext` field for full container SC override. Defaults no longer set `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem` or `RunAsUser`. |

**Design change — SecurityContext:**

Before: hardcoded container SC with `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `AllowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, drop all caps.

Now:
- If `runner.Spec.SecurityContext` is set → use it as-is (full override)
- If unset → apply secure defaults: `AllowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, drop all caps, `SeccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`. **No** `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem` or `RunAsUser` — these are opt-in.

**Files modified:**
- `api/v1alpha1/runner_types.go` — added `SecurityContext *corev1.SecurityContext`
- `internal/controller/runner_controller.go` — dynamic SC in `buildJob`, RBAC `pods delete`
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go` — RBAC `namespaces` fixed
- `internal/controller/runner_controller_unit_test.go` — 2 new SC unit tests
- `internal/controller/runner_controller_test.go` — SC test assertion updated
- `config/rbac/role.yaml` — regenerated
- `config/crd/bases/` — regenerated
- `dist/chart/templates/crd/` — synced
- `dist/install.yaml` — regenerated

**Tests added:**
| Test | What it verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `TestBuildJob_SecurityContext_default` | Default SC has `AllowPrivilegeEscalation=false`, drop all caps, **no** `ReadOnlyRootFilesystem` |
| `TestBuildJob_SecurityContext_custom` | Custom SC replaces defaults entirely |

**Verification:**
- `make manifests generate build-installer` — OK
- `make test` — 25/25 specs passing (9.9s, 59.5% coverage)
- `go vet ./...` — OK

### Session 20 — Retry counter, chart RBAC, sharedVolume sample fixes

**Source:** Integration tester `findings.log` (v0.3.4 chart)

| # | Finding | Fix |
|---|---------|------|
| 1 | Chart RBAC template `dist/chart/templates/rbac/manager-role.yaml` out of sync with `config/rbac/role.yaml` | Rewrote chart template to match: added `namespaces`, `pods/log`, `pods:delete` |
| 2 | Retry counter never increments past 1 — `!hasRunner` branch uses `append` instead of `upsertStepStatus`, creating duplicate `StepStatus` entry that resets `RetryCount` | Fixed: replaced `append` with `upsertStepStatus`, added message fallback for new entries |
| 3 | `sharedVolume` with `emptyDir` sample suggests data sharing across steps (impossible — each step gets its own Pod) | Removed the `write`→`read` emptyDir pattern from the sample; kept volume/mount demo in `deploy` job |

**Root cause of Fix 2 (retry counter):**

Before:
```go
// line 321 — creates a new StepStatus entry, discarding RetryCount
wf.Status.StepStatuses = append(wf.Status.StepStatuses, runnersv1alpha1.StepStatus{
    Name:    step.Name,
    Phase:   runnersv1alpha1.StepPhasePending,
    Message: "Runner created",
})
```

After:
```go
// upsertStepStatus preserves existing RetryCount on retry
upsertStepStatus(wf, step.Name, runnersv1alpha1.StepPhasePending)
// message only set for genuinely new entries (empty Message)
for i, s := range wf.Status.StepStatuses {
    if s.Name == step.Name && s.Phase == runnersv1alpha1.StepPhasePending && s.Message == "" {
        wf.Status.StepStatuses[i].Message = "Runner created"
        break
    }
}
```

**Files modified:**
- `internal/controller/workflow_controller.go` — retry counter fix in `reconcileStepLoop`
- `dist/chart/templates/rbac/manager-role.yaml` — full rewrite to match role.yaml
- `dist/chart/templates/samples/workflow-volumes.yaml` — removed broken emptyDir sharedVolume
- `dist/chart/Chart.yaml` — v0.3.5
- `dist/install.yaml` — regenerated

**Verification:**
- `make manifests generate build-installer` — OK
- `helm lint dist/chart` — 1 info, 0 failures
- `make test` — 25/25 specs passing (10.0s, 60.1% coverage)
- `go vet ./...` — OK

### Session 21 — Pre-flight checks (RBAC self-awareness + CRD validation)

**Why:** Integration tests revealed two maintenance pain points:
1. **Chart RBAC template gets stale** — devs had to manually copy CRDs and remember to sync
2. **No RBAC informer** — operator can't detect when its ClusterRole is patched (permissions added/removed)
3. **Silent CRD mismatch** — `helm upgrade` doesn't update CRDs; operator had no way to warn users

**What was built:**

#### 1. Pre-flight RBAC check (`internal/startup/rbac.go`)
- Uses `SelfSubjectRulesReview` (zero extra RBAC required — any subject can self-review)
- Checks all 50+ expected permissions from `config/rbac/role.yaml` against actual granted rules
- Logs each missing permission as a warning with `resource`, `verb`, `group` fields
- Runs at operator startup and reports count of missing permissions

#### 2. Periodic RBAC re-check (`startup.RbacCheckRunnable`)
- Runs every 5 minutes as a controller-runtime `Runnable`
- Tracks previous permission state and logs when permissions are added or removed
- If a permission was present and is now missing: `"RBAC permission was removed - operator restart may be required"`
- If a permission was missing and is now present: `"RBAC permission was added - operator restart may be required to use new features"`

#### 3. Pre-flight CRD validation (`internal/startup/crd.go`)
- Lists `CustomResourceDefinition` objects (needs new `apiextensions.k8s.io` RBAC marker)
- Checks that all 3 managed CRDs (`runners`, `workflows`, `eventtriggers`) are installed
- Validates that the expected version (`v1alpha1`) is served
- Logs actionable message: `"CRD version mismatch - upgrade the CRDs with 'kubectl apply -f <crd-file>'"`
- This catches the common `helm upgrade` pitfall where CRDs are not updated

#### 4. `make sync-chart` target
- Single command: runs `manifests generate`, copies CRDs from `config/crd/bases/` to `dist/chart/templates/crd/`, then rebuilds `dist/install.yaml`
- Prevents chart CRDs from getting out of sync with the source of truth

**Files modified:**
- `internal/startup/rbac.go` — RBAC self-check + periodic runnable
- `internal/startup/crd.go` — CRD version validation
- `cmd/main.go` — wired pre-flight checks and periodic Runnable
- `internal/controller/runner_controller.go` — added `apiextensions.k8s.io` RBAC marker
- `Makefile` — added `sync-chart` target
- `config/rbac/role.yaml` — regenerated with CRD listing RBAC
- `config/crd/bases/` — regenerated
- `dist/chart/templates/crd/` — synced via `make sync-chart`
- `dist/install.yaml` — regenerated
- `dist/chart/Chart.yaml` — v0.3.6

**Verification:**
- `make manifests generate fmt vet` — clean (no compile errors)
- `helm lint dist/chart` — 1 info, 0 failures
- `make test` — 25/25 specs passing (9.7s, 60.1% coverage)
- `make sync-chart` — clean (CRDs synced, installer regenerated)
